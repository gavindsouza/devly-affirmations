# Devly Affirmations

Affirmations for the qU1rkY dev in you ;)

## How to use?

This project is currently deployed at https://affirmations.gavindsouza.in. The site is pretty simple such that it returns a random affirmation each time you make a call. 

The best way to use this project is by consuming it from your favourite interface built for affirmations, which for me looks like:

```bash
~ curl -s https://affirmations.gavindsouza.in | fx 'x.affirmation' | cowsay

                ||----w |
                ||     ||

```

## How to contribute?

To contribute affirmations, all you need to do is open an issue via the ["Affirmation Form"](//github.com/gavindsouza/devly-affirmations/issues/new?assignees=&labels=affirmation&template=submit_affirmation.yml) template. A "LGTM" comment from one of the maintainers will merge your contribution into the source üòÅ. Alternatively, you can choose to update the `affirmations.json` file manually.

A deploy is triggered on each push to the default branch. Special thanks to deta.sh for the hosting.
